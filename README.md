# Additive-Tensor-Decomposition-Considering-Structural-Data-Information
These are supplementary materials for the paper 'Additive Tensor Decomposition Considering Structural Data Information'.
It includes three videos for better illustration of the simulation/case study results.
## 4.1	Simulation study for Example 1
The data for monitoring the crack growing process include <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?I_1=30 " /> consecutive measurement images of size 40×40. These images form a tensor M in R^(30×40×40). We simulate M by summing up two tensors <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?X_1 " /> 
 and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?X_2 " />  that represent the background and the crack, respectively. Each <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?X_1 (i,:,:),i∈[I_1 ], " /> is generated by a 2D smooth Gaussian process representing the background. Most values in the image <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?X_2 (i,:,:) " />  are zeros, and the non-zero values of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?X_2 (i,:,:) " />  gradually grows when the index i increases from 1 to 30, representing the crack growing on the wall. These values are generated from i.i.d. <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?N(0.1,0.1) " />  random variables to represent the random lighting and shadowing conditions.  The first images of Figure 6 (a) and Figure 6 (b) illustrate the 20th and the 30th image in M, the second images illustrate the corresponding images for actual crack which is a continuous line and the third image illustrate the images for the simulated crack under irregularly illuminated conditions.
We then decompose M into two components <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?X_1 " />  and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?X_2 " />  by solving Problem (2). In the ADMM algorithm, the step size is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?η=0.01 " />. The fifth images of Figures 6 (a), (b) illustrate the estimated crack of the 20th and the 30th image using the ATD-based method. It is shown that the ATD-based method captures the growth of the whole crack accurately. 

## 4.2	Simulation study for Example 2
The tensor M in Example 2 is generated to simulate the consecutive measurements taken from a thermal camera in a heated surface monitoring process. It also contains 30 images of size 40×40, and it is generated by summing up three tensors <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?X_1, X_2, and X_3 " />  of the same size that represents the true background, the static hotspot, and the moving hotspot respectively. Among them, each mode 1 slice of the tensor <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?X_1 " />   is generated from 
 <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?X(i,:,:)=U_i T_0+(1-U) T_1 " />
where  <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?T_0 " /> is a 40×40 matrix representing the heating effect of the heating process, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?T_1" /> is a matrix of the same size representing the cooling effect and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?U" /> is a <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?U[0,1]" /> random variable representing a random combination of the two effects. 
The images representing the matrices <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?T_0" /> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?T_1" /> are shown in the following figure.

To simulate the heating effect of a single point heating source at the center of this image, we generate <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?T_0 (i,j)" /> using the value of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?f_0 (i,j)" />, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?f_0" /> is the probability density function of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?N((20,20)^T,10I)" />, where I is a 2×2 identity matrix. Then, we transform all values of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?T_0" /> linearly such that the maximum and minimum value of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?T_0" /> are 1 and 0, respectively. With this setup, the maximum value within <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?T_0" /> is 1, located at the center of the image; when the pixel moves farther way from the center, the value of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?T_0 (i,j)" /> gradually drops to 0.  To simulate the cooling effect, we generate <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?T_1 (i,j))" /> using a linear function <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?f_1 (i,j)=c_1 (i+j)+c_2" />, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?c_1" /> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?c_2" /> are adjusted so that the maximum and minimum value within the matrix <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?T_1" /> are 0 and 1 respectively. It represents that the coolant for the surface flows from the upper-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the image. 

Each image within the tensor <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?X_2" /> are the same, and the non-zero values in these images are located in a fixed 2×2 rectangle with intensity value 1 in their lower-left corners. The non-zero values in each image of the tensor <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?X_3" /> are also located in a 2×2 rectangle with intensity value 1. However, this rectangle locates on the upper-left part of the image.  When the image index i increases, the rectangle in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?X_3 (i,:,:)" /> moves from the left side to the right side across the images.
