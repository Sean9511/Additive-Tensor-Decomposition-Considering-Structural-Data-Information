# Additive-Tensor-Decomposition-Considering-Structural-Data-Information
These are supplementary materials for the paper 'Additive Tensor Decomposition Considering Structural Data Information'.
It includes three videos for better illustration of the simulation/case study results.
4.1	Simulation study for Example 1
The data for monitoring the crack growing process include I_1=30 consecutive measurement images of size 40×40. These images form a tensor M∈R^(30×40×40). We simulate M by summing up two tensors - <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?X_1 " /> 
 and X_2 that represent the background and the crack, respectively. Each X_1 (i,:,:),i∈[I_1 ], is generated by a 2D smooth Gaussian process representing the background. Most values in the image X_2 (i,:,:) are zeros, and the non-zero values of X_2 (i,:,:) gradually grows when the index i increases from 1 to 30, representing the crack growing on the wall. These values are generated from i.i.d. N(0.1,0.1)  random variables to represent the random lighting and shadowing conditions.  The first images of Figure 6 (a) and Figure 6 (b) illustrate the 20th and the 30th image in M, the second images illustrate the corresponding images for actual crack which is a continuous line and the third image illustrate the images for the simulated crack under irregularly illuminated conditions.
We then decompose M into two components X ̂_1 and X ̂_2 by solving Problem (2). In the ADMM algorithm, the step size is η=0.01, and the tuning parameters are λ_1,1=λ_1,2=1,λ_2,1=10, and λ_2,2=0.08. The fifth images of Figures 6 (a), (b) illustrate the estimated crack of the 20th and the 30th image using the ATD-based method. It is shown that the ATD-based method captures the growth of the whole crack accurately. 

4.2	Simulation study for Example 2
The tensor M in Example 2 is generated to simulate the consecutive measurements taken from a thermal camera in a heated surface monitoring process. It also contains 30 images of size 40×40, and it is generated by summing up three tensors X_1, X_2, and X_3 of the same size that represents the true background, the static hotspot, and the moving hotspot respectively. Among them, each mode 1 slice of the tensor X_1 is generated from 
X(i,:,:)=U_i T_0+(1-U) T_1
where T_0 is a 40×40 matrix representing the heating effect of the heating process, T_1 is a matrix of the same size representing the cooling effect and U is a U[0,1] random variable representing a random combination of the two effects. 
The images representing the matrices T_0 and T_1 are shown in Figure 7. To simulate the heating effect of a single point heating source at the center of this image, we generate T_0 (i,j) using the value of f_0 (i,j), where f_0 is the probability density function of N((20,20)^⊤,10I), where I is a 2×2 identity matrix. Then, we transform all values of T_0 linearly such that the maximum and minimum value of T_0 are 1 and 0, respectively. With this setup, the maximum value within T_0 is 1, located at the center of the image; when the pixel moves farther way from the center, the value of T_0 (i,j) gradually drops to 0.  To simulate the cooling effect, we generate T_1 (i,j) using a linear function f_1 (i,j)=c_1 (i+j)+c_2, where c_1 and c_2 are adjusted so that the maximum and minimum value within the matrix T_1 are 0 and 1 respectively. It represents that the coolant for the surface flows from the upper-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the image. 
	Each image within the tensor X_2 are the same, and the non-zero values in these images are located in a fixed 2×2 rectangle with intensity value 1 in their lower-left corners. The non-zero values in each image of the tensor X_3 are also located in a 2×2 rectangle with intensity value 1. However, this rectangle locates on the upper-left part of the image.  When the image index i increases, the rectangle in X_3 (i,:,:) moves from the left side to the right side across the images.
